# Builds OpenHamClock Rig Listener executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
# Triggers on pushes that tag a rig-listener release, or manually via workflow_dispatch.
#
# Each platform builds on its native runner so the serialport native addon
# is compiled correctly. The resulting executables are uploaded as artifacts
# and attached to the GitHub Release.
